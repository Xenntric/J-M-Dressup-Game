Art workflow rules

Julius will probably give me some beautiful art assets that have canvases that dont
always meet the bounds of the asset, so i will need to crop it down to the edges
then increase canvas sizes by lets say 20px? I think thats fine, and will allow me
to create a 'selected' version with a border around the whole asset

Get asset -> crop -> resize canvas -> create alt versions

could probably use a texturepacker instead to maximise efficiency but i can think
about that after ive made the actual assets
